				|A materials reference collection, begun in the early 1960's is a repository of reference samples for use in the comparative analysis of art objects. We must seize the opportunities and challenges of providing broader access to such information as part of the growing online accessibility of museum collections.

			|The collection includes tubes of paint and the multitudinous raw materials historically used for paint manufacture and employed in pictorial art.
			|Since its humble beginning, the collection has grown to more than several thousand samples. Housed today as separate collections in the three partner institutions, it has exceptional potential as a support for the research and service functions of the CATS consortium and associated partners, the conservation laboratories of the National Gallery of Denmark, National Museum of Denmark and School of Conservation, as well as the international conservation community.
			|In order to fully exploit and benefit from the valuable resources of the sample collection, it must be catalogued digitally to allow advanced searching. A vast amount of documentation is continuously being generated by the scientific staff and conservators at the partner institutions, and it is our aim to assemble, organise and upload the data in a database for historical, scientific and technical information. This will be available from terminals located in the CATS documentation centre.
